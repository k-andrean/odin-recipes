	<h3>Ingredients</h3>

	<ul>
		<li>2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (about 1.3 lb. total</li>
		<li>2 tsp Italian seasoning </li>
		<li>2 Tbsp butter</li>
		<li>1 Tbsp cooking oil</li>
		<li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
		<li>1 cup heavy cream </li>
		<li>1 Tbsp chopped parsley (optional garnish)</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Steps</h3>

	<ol>
		<li>Season both sides of the chicken breast with Italian seasoning and a pinch of salt.</li>
		<li>Heat a large skillet over medium. Once hot, add the cooking oil and swirl to coat the surface. Add the chicken to the skillet and cook for about 7-8 minutes on each side, or until browned on the outside and cooked through.</li>
		<li>Remove the chicken to a clean plate and turn the heat under the skillet down to medium-low.</li>
		<li>Add the butter and minced garlic to the skillet. Stir and cook the garlic in the melted butter for about two minutes, dissolving the browned bits from the bottom of the skillet as you stir.</li>
		<li>Add the heavy cream and whisk to combine, dissolving any remaining browned bits. Allow the cream to come up to a simmer.</li>
		<li>While waiting for the cream to simmer, bring a pot of water to a boil for the fettuccine. Once boiling, add the pasta and continue to boil until tender (about 7 minutes). Reserve about Â½ cup of the starchy cooking water just before draining the pasta.</li>
