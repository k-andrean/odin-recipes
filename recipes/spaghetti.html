		Spaghetti is a long, thin, solid, cylindrical pasta. It is a staple food of traditional Italian cuisine. Like other pasta, spaghetti is made of milled wheat, water, and sometimes enriched with vitamins and minerals. Italian spaghetti is typically made from durum-wheat semolina.

	<h3>Ingredients</h3>

	<ul>
		<li>1 pound lean ground meat like beef, turkey, chicken or lamb</li>
		<li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
		<li>3 garlic cloves, minced</li>
		<li>1 cup (130 grams) chopped onion</li>
		<li>6 oven-ready lasagna noodles</li>
		<li>1 cup water, broth or dry red wine</li>
		<li>1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
		<li>Salt and fresh ground black pepper</li>
		<li>12 ounces dried spaghetti or favorite pasta shape</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Steps</h3>

	<ol>
		<li>Heat the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat (we use a Dutch oven). Add the meat and cook until browned, about 8 minutes. As the meat cooks, use a wooden spoon to break it up into smaller crumbles.</li>
		<li>Add the onions and cook, stirring every once and a while, until softened, about 5 minutes.</li>
		<li>Stir in the garlic, tomato paste, oregano, and red pepper flakes and cook, stirring continuously for about 1 minute.</li>
		<li>Pour in the water and use a wooden spoon to scrape up any bits of meat or onion stuck to the bottom of the pot. Stir in the tomatoes, 3/4 teaspoon of salt, and a generous pinch of black pepper. Bring the sauce to a low simmer. Cook, uncovered, at a low simmer for 25 minutes. As it cooks, stir and taste the sauce a few times so you can adjust the seasoning accordingly (see notes for suggestions).</li>
		<li>About 15 minutes before the sauce finishes cooking, bring a large pot of salted water to the boil, and then cook pasta according to package directions, but check for doneness a minute or two before the suggested cooking time.</li>
		<li>Take the sauce off of the heat, and then stir in the basil. Toss in the cooked pasta, and then leave for a minute so that the pasta absorbs some of the sauce. Toss again, and then serve with parmesan sprinkled on top./li>
